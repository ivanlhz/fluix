# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality,
personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:
- Being respectful and constructive
- Accepting feedback gracefully
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy toward others

Examples of unacceptable behavior:
- Harassment, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Public or private intimidation
- Publishing others' private information without permission
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to unacceptable behavior.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and in public spaces
when an individual is officially representing the project.

## Enforcement

To report violations, open an issue and mark it with `code-of-conduct`.
Maintainers may move the conversation to a private channel if needed.

All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Attribution
